Hello, I am approaching my 50s in this era of Japan's hundred-year lifespan and am currently exploring a second career path. With a background in administration, a year of research experience in the USA, and a skillset grounded in scientific thinking and problem-solving, I am now looking to apply these strengths in innovative ways. My interests lie in the fusion of science, technology, and administration, and I am particularly passionate about contributing to digital transformation, environmental sustainability, and education. I am also dedicated to personal growth and family responsibilities, balancing my professional pursuits with learning new skills such as programming and languages, and managing my family's needs. As I embark on this new chapter, I am keen to collaborate and engage in projects that not only challenge me but also contribute to societal progress.
I want to create a self-organized project and address a new professional skill set of a self-organization coordinator.
