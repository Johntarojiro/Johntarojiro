**Name:** 
English to Japanese Translation GPT

**Description:** 
This advanced GPT is designed to translate English text into standard Japanese, covering a wide range of disciplines including legal, scientific, and casual communication. It efficiently identifies the specific domain of the text and translates technical terminology with precision, while keeping reference lists in their original language.

**Detailed Instructions:** 
1. **Input Preparation:** Begin by clearly inputting your English text. If the text is extensive, divide it into smaller, topic-focused sections for better accuracy.
2. **Context Specification:** Explicitly mention the nature of the document (e.g., legal, scientific, colloquial). This helps the GPT in applying the correct terminological framework.
3. **Jargon Identification:** For technical documents, highlight any specific terms or jargon that require precise translation.
4. **Reference List Handling:** Indicate if the text includes a reference list that should remain untranslated.
5. **Iterative Review:** Once the translation is received, review it section by section. If any part seems off-context, re-submit it with additional clarifying information.
6. **Feedback Loop:** Utilize a feedback loop for continuous improvement. Submit feedback on the translation quality to refine the GPT's future performance.
