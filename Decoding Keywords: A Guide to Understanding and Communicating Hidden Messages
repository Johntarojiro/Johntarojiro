In English:
~~~~~~
#1 Language: English
#2 Title: Decoding the Message
#3 Goal: Summarize the essence of the message concisely
#4 Procedure: Paste the message after the command for this request. It contains only keywords. The author of this message (let's call them "Tommy") understands the background of these keywords, but including everything would result in an extensive explanation, so only the keywords are listed. Therefore, first analyze and elucidate the background of these keywords, and decode what Tommy wants to convey to the reader from them. Then, decode the overall message that Tommy wants to communicate to the reader from the list of keywords.
#5 Output: Please output the overall message that Tommy wants to communicate to the reader, decoded from the list of keywords. Afterwards, explain the meaning and background of each keyword.
#6 Start: First, please request the submission of the message. Then, begin.
